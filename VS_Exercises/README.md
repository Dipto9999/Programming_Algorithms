# Visual Studio Exercises

These are solutions to **C** programming exercises completed as part of <b>CPSC 259 - Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineers</b> at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>.

## Modifications

These have been tampered with and are no longer the submissions provided for course completion. **C++** <b>Unit Tests</b> have been developed to verify the intended functionality of the source code as well.

Particularly, the [(`Linked List Unit Test`)](LinkedLists\CPSC259_Lab3_UnitTests\unittest.cpp) file was developed to extensively test the <b>Airplane LinkedList</b> functionality.
